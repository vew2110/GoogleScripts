## Add Public Holidays to Team Calendar

If you want to keep track of the public holidays in all the different countries the team is working from, but in a central and shared way you can use this script. You can feed in the public holiday calendars you care about and add the events to your team calendar. If you mess up, I also included a function to remove them from the team calendar again. These are found in addPublicHolidaysToTeamCalendar
