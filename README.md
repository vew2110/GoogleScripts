## Add Public Holidays to Team Calendar

If you want to keep track of the public holidays in all the different countries the team is working from, but in a central and shared way you can use this script. You can feed in the public holiday calendars you care about and add the events to your team calendar. If you mess up, I also included a function to remove them from the team calendar again. These are found in addPublicHolidaysToTeamCalendar


## Add OOOs to Team Calendar

This will iterate through the calendars of a group to find Out of Office events and add them to the Team Calendar. /addOOOsToTeamCalendar


## Synce personal to Work calendar

This will add, update and delete events that are on your personal calendar to your work calendar, with descriptions that you choose (ex. you can just block time as "personal event"). This will allow you to have an overview of work and private commitments, and ensure you don't get double-booked.
